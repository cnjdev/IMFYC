# If McDonald's Fits Your Calories (IMFYC)

Nutritional web app which compiles McDonald's meals based on desired caloric intake.  Also finds nearest McDonald's to detected location (if allowed) or user-entered location (if not allowed to use current location)

I developed the logic checking the user's location using the HTML5 Navigator.Geolocation feature and the Google API calls allowing the user to enter a location, finding the nearest McDonald's from that location or detected location, and getting directions.
